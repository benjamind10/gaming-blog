<![CDATA[ <p>Every month, Microsoft gives <strong>Xbox Live Gold</strong> subscribers four games to add to their digital libraries.

<![CDATA[ <p>Originally introduced in Forsaken, the PvPvE game mode known as Gambit provided <strong><em>Destiny 2</em></strong> players a fresh experience to stand alongside the typical Crucible and PvE content. Mixing both elements together, teams of four battled enemy NPCs in order to pick up motes to deposit into a bank. Essentially a race to see who could not only fill their bank but defeat the Primeval boss first, <a href="https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-gambit-counter-invader-video-clip/">opposing <em>Destiny 2</em> teams could periodically invade</a> to try and hinder the other squad. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Since<strong><em> Cyberpunk 2077 </em></strong>received its recent overhaul, it&#39;s safe to say that the game feels better than ever before as the update revitalizes almost every aspect of Night City. The list of said fixes includes tweaks to AI behavior and skill balance, adding additional elements to the world, and overhauling the driving mechanics. However, although <a href="http://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-halves-file-size/"><em>Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s</em> massive update added many new features</a>, it also removed and capped quite a number too, including a limit on the double jump height. Now, one Reddit user has set out to break this limit by reaching areas of Night City that are out of bounds.</p> ]]>

</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Amazon-published MMO <strong><em>Lost Ark </em></strong>continues to be massively popular as one of Steam&#39;s most-played games. Free-to-play access to the MMO has certainly played a major part in <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/lost-ark/"><em>Lost Ark</em></a>&#39;s success, but so has the fact that Amazon localized a game that&#39;s been available for several years. That extra polish, years of availability in South Korea before being brought west, has given <em>Lost Ark</em> the momentum it needed to continue its launch success. It also means there&#39;s a pipeline of content arriving in <em>Lost Ark</em> faster than expected.</p> ]]>

</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>It seems as if the pandemic is slowly making its way towards the endgame. In December 2021, The Game Awards staff made the decision to do an in-person event, marking one of the first major events anywhere to do so in the past 2 years. The event was a pretty big success all things considered, as the then rise of the Omicron variant was causing some hesitation towards meeting in-person. Now, Gamescom has announced its return in August 2022 with dates and the news that it will be returning to an in-person show, as well as continuing to host a digital component. The show will also play host towards <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/gamescom/">Gamescom</a>&#39;s first &quot;climate-friendly&quot; event.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Though many gamers enjoy the spectacle, vast open worlds and enhanced graphics of games with a massive, AAA budget, it&#39;s no secret that a lot of gaming fans also appreciate the smaller, indie titles out there. As smaller game developers are able to put out their creations more easily, the popularity of indie games has increased, with the genre evolving exponentially, even with its own online marketplaces such as the <a href="https://gamerant.com/game-funding-platform-nfts-scam/">popular site Itch.io</a>.</p> ]]>

</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Many gamers and PC enthusiasts have been curious, and perhaps even eager, about the upcoming discrete graphics card range from <strong>Intel</strong>. Competing against the likes of Nvidia and AMD in the big leagues, the <a href="https://gamerant.com/intel-may-miss-q1-window-arc-alchemist/">Arc Alchemist GPU has already missed its Q1 window</a>, or at least it will do if it doesn&#39;t release by the end of this month. While it was allegedly supposed to launch sometime at the beginning of this year, it seems as though the company has pushed it back some, and now rumors speculate that the first line of its upcoming products may not be on shelves until the summer.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong>, like many other competitive shooters, battle royales, and <em>Call of Duty </em>games, has an active competitive scene. <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>has had players competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars in the game, so it&#39;s safe to say that the pros of the game take tournaments seriously. As with any other competitive game or sport, cheating isn&#39;t welcome, and even glitches can cause pros to become unhappy with the way a tournament plays out, such as on one occasion when <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-warzone-player-becomes-plane-tournament-pros-angry/">a <em>Warzone</em> player turned into a plane due to a glitch</a>.</p> ]]>

<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>The industry is currently going through something of a phase in which, instead of releasing unique games with compelling stories, publishers are churning out upscaled and graphically tweaked versions of already existing properties. While some <a href="https://gamerant.com/remakes-remasters-worked-didnt/">video game remakes and remasters like <em>Resident Evil 2</em></a> are considered good, there are others which painfully fail to hit the mark. The less said about the launch days of <em>Grand Theft Auto: Definitive Edition</em>, the better. Sometimes it&#39;s good to see improved versions of games that everyone loves, but there are times when fans&#39; hopes can be dashed, as some <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> players discovered.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Final Fantasy 14&#039;s latest update appears to have broken support of the MMO on Valve&#039;s new handheld PC platform, the Steam Deck. ]]>
</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>Valve&#39;s Steam Deck is now shipping out to early preorderers of the handheld PC device. It&#39;s a new idea, a proprietary console made by Valve with a custom Linux-based OS designed specifically for PC games. As with most new ideas, there are still some kinks to work out. Take for example <strong><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></strong>, which was advertised for the Steam Deck by Valve CEO Gabe Newell. A new update for the MMO has rendered <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/final-fantasy-14/"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> completely unplayable on the Steam Deck, with no fix in sight.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>As the war between Russia and Ukraine continues, a number of companies in the video game industry have announced changes to some of their business practices involving the two countries. Earlier this morning, Nintendo made the announcement that it will be delaying its strategy game <strong><em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</em></strong> to an unspecified date. Given the content of <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/advance-wars/"><em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</em></a> involves modern combat, Nintendo likely felt releasing this game right now would be in poor taste.</p> ]]>

<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[ <p>As the latest game from the developers of the <em>Evil Within </em>series, <strong><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em></strong>had the interest of horror gamers since it was first <a href="https://gamerant.com/ghostwire-tokyo-announcement-bethesda-e3-2019/">unveiled back at E3 2019</a>. For a while, all that fans knew about the title was that it would include horror elements, that the majority of the population had gone missing, and, as the name would suggest, it is set in Tokyo. Now, though, not only do those looking forward to the upcoming release of <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em>have some solid information on the game, they also have an introduction into its world.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong> season 2 has been going for a few weeks now, and it remains massively popular. But there have been reports from players that the game is marred with glitches and bugs. This isn&#39;t usually a huge problem for games like<em> <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/call-of-duty-warzone/">Warzone</a></em> which are continually worked on and updated. It can be expected that any bugs will be ironed out in short order. But it can be more frustrating when the glitch is part of a DLC pack paid for with real money.</p> ]]>

It has the same DNA as FromSoftware&rsquo;s other games, but its status as a new IP means more new players are willing to try it out. It is also more accessible than ever to play the class of character one wants, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean these games have lost their unforgiving edge.</p> ]]>
